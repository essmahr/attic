        alt="when I was a kid I was very lucky to have parents who purchased a large swath of empty land in the interior of B.C. (most of it was waterlogged, inaccessible marshland and I don’t think it was a very good investment) We drove up there a few times a year, and slept and cooked in a tent trailer."

      <img
        src="/power-to-be/power-to-be-2.png"
        alt="Even though I live and work in a dense urban environment, having access to these vast swaths of outdoor space during my childhood years really informed how I now live in the world. Having the opportunity to appreciate our dependence on the natural resources around us, and to understand and experience the power of wilderness and empty space as tools for self-reflection, regeneration, and bonding with family and friends is invaluable."

      <img
        src="/power-to-be/power-to-be-3.png"
        alt="Even the small things can have an impact, like spending a couple days with a rationed water supply, or getting slightly lost in the woods, or the surprise inhalation of steam propelled by the campfire you just extinguished with your own urine, seconds before."
      />
      <img
        src="/power-to-be/power-to-be-4.png"
        alt="I was (and am) very blessed in that there were no barriers between myself and accessing the outdoors. But of course getting that access can be a great challenge for a great many people, even in a place like B.C., where the wilderness can feel so close — whether it be financial, or it can be because of a mental or physical disability."
      />
      <img
        src="/power-to-be/power-to-be-5.png"
        alt="Power To Be is an organization that facilitates that access, and nurtures those connections to the outdoors for the youth and families who need it most. And there is a fundraiser happening on May 29th to raise money to get more folks out there, into the fresh and open air, putting out their campfires however they wish, so long as it is responsible."
